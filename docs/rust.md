## Crate and Mod in Rust
* **Crate**: A crate is the highest level of organization in Rust. It's a package of Rust code. Each crate will compile to a library or a binary. Crates can depend on other crates, which can be added to your project through the Cargo.toml file. Each crate has a root module that contains all the other modules in the crate.
* **Mod**: A mod (module) is a way of organizing code within a crate. Modules allow you to group related definitions together and manage the namespaces of your libraries. You can define modules in Rust with the mod keyword.
